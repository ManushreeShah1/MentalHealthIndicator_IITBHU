# MentalHealthIndicator - IITBHU
The below description was recieved for the Hackathon Jagriti by IITBHU, as participated. This file contains solution for the same.


In response to the growing awareness of mental health
issues, there is an urgent demand for the creation of
practical tools that can aid individuals in identifying and
addressing their mental health concerns. The dataset
furnished for this purpose includes the PRIMATE dataset,
specifically designed to facilitate the training of a
classification model. Your assigned task is to develop a
classification model that categorizes paragraphs based
on the dataset's presence or absence of specific mental
health indicators.

DATASET OVERVIEW:

The PRIMATE dataset is designed to support the
development of models for mental health triaging. It
includes a collection of posts, each containing a title, post
text, and annotations that provide insights into the mental
state of individuals. The dataset is carefully curated to
indicate the presence or absence of various mental health
indicators within these posts.
Here's a detailed breakdown of the components in the
dataset:

Posts: Each entry in the dataset consists of a post, which
typically includes the individual's expression of their mental
health condition. These posts may contain details about
symptoms, experiences, or concerns related to mental
health.

Title: A title accompanies each post, providing a brief
overview or heading for the content. Titles can offer a quick
glimpse into the primary focus or theme of the
corresponding post.
Post Text: The main body of the post text contains the
individual's narrative about their mental health. This could
encompass a wide range of information, such as
descriptions of emotions, experiences, challenges, or
requests for support.
Annotations: The dataset is enriched with annotations that
indicate the presence or absence of specific mental health
indicators within each post. These annotations are crucial in
training classification models to categorize posts based on
relevant mental health criteria.

Mental Health Indicators: The indicators in the annotations
could cover a diverse set of aspects, potentially including
symptoms of depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, or other
mental health conditions. These indicators are essential for
developing a model that recognizes and categorizes posts
based on the exhibited mental health characteristics.

Overall, the PRIMATE dataset provides a comprehensive and
labeled collection of posts with associated information,
facilitating the training of classification models to categorize
posts based on their mental health content automatically.
This resource is invaluable for advancing research and
development in mental health awareness and support.
